						<p>
							Smarter Software was founded on the idea that too many business
							spend too many hours doing things that could be automated.
						</p>
						<p>
							We believe that every business can benefit from the power of
							having porprietary software designed and tailored specifically for
							them. No two businesses are the same, and software should not be a
							one-size-fits all solution; instead we design from the ground up a
							software solution that can reach all aspects of your business,
							helping you and your team work smarter, leaving the grunt work to
							the software.
						</p>
						<p>
							Our mission is to help organizations of all sizes, big and small,
							take their business to the next level, and with comptetitive
							pricing, every business is our target market.
